Image classification using Python and Tensorflow.

Model is recognizing screenshots from whis WebSDR stream: http://websdr.ewi.utwente.nl:8901/

At the monent there is only two classes "amsignal" and "nosignal". Signal screenshots has been captured in AM frequencies. Although at the moment I think model will put all signals in AM class anyway.
